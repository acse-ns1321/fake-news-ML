# Challenges
# Take reasonable steps to mitigate multicolinearity.
# Check whether we have met each of the 4 assumptions behind linear regression.
# If we have not met some of these assumption, is there anything (preferably something simple) that we can do to make sure we do satisfy them? If so, try to implement it.
# How do you know that you have the correct hyperparemeter k when using k-means? Try using the Elbow method.
# Can you improve the regression performance by incorporating the clustering results as an additional feature?
# Can you linearly interpolate across the principal components, reconstructing the corresponding images? What do you notice?
